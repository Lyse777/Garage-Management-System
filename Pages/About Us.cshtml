    <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Founded in 2002, HC Garage began as a small, family-run garage driven by a passion for cars and a commitment to service excellence. Over the years, we encountered firsthand the complexities and challenges of garage management – from juggling appointments to tracking inventory and maintaining customer relationships. Fueled by these experiences and a desire to redefine automotive service standards, we developed our Garage Management System.</p>
            <p>Our journey has been one of constant innovation and improvement. We've embraced technology, not just to simplify operations, but to elevate the entire automotive service experience. Today, our system is at the heart of everything we do, enabling us to deliver unparalleled service efficiency and accuracy, and empowering other garages to do the same.</p>
